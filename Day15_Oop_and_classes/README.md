A Python project that simulates a coffee machine using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
 

---

## 📌 Project Summary  
The Coffee Machine OOP Project replicates the functionality of a real coffee machine.  
- Users can order different drinks (espresso, latte, cappuccino).  
- The machine checks if there are enough resources (water, milk, coffee).  
- It processes coins and handles transactions.  
- If payment is successful and resources are available, the drink is prepared.  
- Users can also check a **report** of remaining resources and total money earned.

## 🛠️ Features  
- Implemented with **classes and objects** for better structure.  
- Menu system to display drink options.  
- Coin-based payment system (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies).  
- Tracks resources (water, milk, coffee) and updates after each order.  
- "Report" command to check machine status.  
- "Off" command to turn off the machine.
