🐢 Turtle Race Game
📌 Summary

A fun Python game built using the turtle graphics module where players bet on a turtle’s color and watch them race across the screen. The first turtle to cross the finish line wins, and the game tells you if your bet was correct!

🎮 Description

 This project is a beginner-friendly Python program that uses the turtle graphics library.

 At the start, the player is asked to place a bet by choosing a turtle’s color (red, blue, green, purple, black, or orange).

 Six turtles line up at the starting line.

 Each turtle moves forward by a random distance on each turn, making the race unpredictable and exciting.

 When one turtle crosses the finish line, the program announces the winning color and whether the player’s bet was correct.

 This project is great for practicing loops, conditionals, randomization, and working with Python’s turtle graphics.

🚀 How to Run

 Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

 Save the code in a file called turtle_race.py.

 Run the script:

 python turtle_race.py


A window will open — place your bet by typing a color in the input box.

Watch the turtles race to the finish line! 🏁
