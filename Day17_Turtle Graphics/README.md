This project is a fun visualization built with Python’s turtle module. The turtle moves in random directions with random colors, creating a colorful “random walk” pattern on the screen. It demonstrates Python basics like loops, functions, and the use of modules such as random and turtle.

📖 Description

 The program uses Python Turtle Graphics to draw a random walk.

 The turtle moves forward with a fixed step size, randomly choosing one of four directions (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°).

 Colors are generated randomly using RGB values (t.colormode(255) is used).

 The drawing speed is set to fastest to create smooth, colorful patterns.

 This project helped me practice:

     Python functions

     Using randomization

     Working with loops

     Applying the Turtle graphics library
